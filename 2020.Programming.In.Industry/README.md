# Abstract

In this article, we share the expriences as developers in the industry (mainly embedded, mass-production, consumer-electronics software).
The intended target audiences include software developers who have just graduated universities and entered companies of such industry or who intend to do so in the near future.
We try to provide what to prepare, study, or know in order to be a good software developer in such companies with shorter time and less effort.
If you find something appear to be important, but had been not aware of, in this article, that would be the best take-away you can get.
Note that we provide similar contents (with more contents but less organized) to newly joined team members so that they can blend in faster and start working effectively immediately.

# Disclaimer

This article is based on very personal experiences, which is limited to a very small section (or department) of the author's empolyee, where there are more than tens of thousands software developers; thus, do not assume this as a textbook.


# Instroduction

Let's move on the main topics right away... for now.


# Main Topics

## Rather technical...

In this sub-section, we will cover rather technical aspects, trying to avoid people-related aspects and to help "to-be" individual contributors who's not going to lead others or start a new project of their own immediately.

### READABILITY

Normally, in the department of computer science of universities, professors may tell you code readability is important in some classes (probably in "software engineering" classes).
However, there are not so many chances to experience the need for readability (of your own codes) in course-work and even if you proceed to graduate schools, getting MS or PHD, in most cases, no one cares the code readability (or the code quality entirely).
When you join a software developer team of more than just a few developers where you are required to read your collegues' codes and your collegues are required to read your codes, regardless of there are active code reviews or not, your code readability becomes suddenly important.


Readbility of your codes becomes important:
- 

### INFRASTRUCTURE (Build, Test, Integrate, Deploy)
### DEPLOYABILITY
### CROSS-PLATFORM
### PERFORMANCE (Latency, Bandwidth, Throughput, Accuracy, ...)
### RELIABILITY: EXCEPTION HANDLING
### MODULARITY
### REUSABILITY & EXPANDABILITY
### LICENSE / LEGAL ISSUES
### DEBUGGING
### PROFILING


## More about people and communities
